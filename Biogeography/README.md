# Biogeograhical analysis

To investigate patterns of vector thermal safety margins based on biogeography, we considered the WWF 14 biomes. 
We assigned all occurrence points to biomes using QGIS using the EcoRegions shapefile: http://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/terrestrial-ecoregions-of-the-world
And the Point Sampling Tool plug-in (to categorize lat/long by biome in the vector biome layer)
