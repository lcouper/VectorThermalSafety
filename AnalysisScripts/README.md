# R scripts used in analysis

1. **VectorThermalSafety_TSMestimation.R**   Used to estimate thermal safety margins and streaks of thermal danger for each species and occurrence record 
2. **VectorThermalSafety_TSMestimation_DroughtMask.R**   Same as File 1, but with periods of drought masked out from TSM calculations
3. **VectorThermalSafety_OccurrencePoints.R**   Used to plot maps of occurrence points used in analysis
4. **VectorThermalSafety_TSMsByLatitude.R**   Used to model and plot patterns of thermal safety across latitude
5. **VectorThermalSafety_TSMbiogeography.R**   Used to investigate patterns of thermal safety by biogeographical regions
6. **VectorThermalSafety_GAMpeaks.R**   Used to identify peaks and valleys in thermal safety across latitude
